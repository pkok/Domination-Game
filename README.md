Domination Game
===============

#### Version 1.6.0

A simulation engine for a multi-agent competitive game. It is meant as an easy experimentation and evaluation
environment for learning about cooperative and competitive autonomous systems. It is:

- **Easy**: written in pure python without dependencies makes sure the code is easy to run
            out-of-the-box and on all platforms. Additionally, the code has a simple API and
            sensible usage.
- **Fast**: the code does not rely on the rendering engine to run simulations, and the collision solver
            is written to be quite fast, leaving plenty of time for agents to think
- **Fair**: the default game rules are tweaked so that it is easy to evaluate the relative skill of agents,
            without too much randomness.
